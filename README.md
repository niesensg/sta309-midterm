This dashboard focuses on Missouri's school district data, including the poverty rate and math/reading scores of each district. I used the all grade levels aggreggated data and excluded any districts that had less than 16 students. Due to data protection, very wide ranges of percent proficient were reported for smaller districts. For any districts with 16-299 students reported, the ranges were split halfway between their upper and lower bound.

Although Missouri has several large cities-- St. Louis, Kansas City, and Jeff City-- the majority of the state geographically speaking is rural. Missouri's school districts are fundly primarily through local property taxes, so many rural areas and less affluent urban areas have underfunded school districts. This issue is exasperated by the large number of private schools, especially in the St. Louis area. 

I chose to highlight the North Daviess School District, which has the highest percentage of students living in poverty, as well as the Ladue School District, which includes several of the wealthiest townships in Missouri. It is evident that the standards of education vary wildly within Missouri and even within its larger cities such as St. Louis.
